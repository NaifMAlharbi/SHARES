**SHARES (Silent Help: Arabic Lip Reading Emergency System)** is a deep learning–based framework designed to recognize **Arabic emergency words** by analyzing lip movements. It leverages an **R(2+1)D** convolutional neural network fine-tuned on a proprietary Arabic dataset to classify commonly used Arabic words in emergency scenarios (e.g., اسعاف, النجدة, etc.).

Key highlights of SHARES:
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Processes webcam input in real time and outputs recognized words.  
- **High-Level Accuracy**: Achieved **76%** test accuracy on a curated dataset of 10 Arabic words.  
- **User-Friendly**: Highlights bounding box around the speaker’s mouth and displays recognized words directly on the video feed.
